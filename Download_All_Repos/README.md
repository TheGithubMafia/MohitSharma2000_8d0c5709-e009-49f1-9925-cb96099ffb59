# Nodejs Script to Download all user repositories

## About 
Github being the top choice for open source and storing our Projects code, it becomes very difficult for us to clone each and every Repository. This is time consuming when we want to have a copy of our github repositories in our PC. SO keeping this in mind I have developed a script to download all github public repositories in once!

## Explanation of code
- We are using shelljs and git to clone individual repositories
- All public repositories are fetched using https get module
- We are storing all repositories in a folder name *Repositories_username*

## To run the code
- Clone the folder
- Inside the folder open command line and run
- npm install
- Then *node repo your_username*
*Your Repositories will start downloading*
