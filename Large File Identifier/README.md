## Large File Identifier

This Script will help to identify/search the files that have a large size than the given size. It helps to identify the hidden files that are present in a folder or file.

### Running a file
1. Run the Script as follows `python3 app.py`
2. Enter the location of the folder you want to serach
3. Enter the minimum file size to serach in a folder. (If you pass 10MB then the script will serach all the files that are greater than 10MB.)
